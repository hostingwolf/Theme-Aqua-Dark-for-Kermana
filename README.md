# In edition, sorry
# Theme-Aqua-Dark for-Kermana
# Infos for Aqua-Dark
### Notes: This theme was developed for the Kermana-Directory script. If you don't have this script, you can visit <a href="https://github.com/cunaedy/Kemana-Directory" target="_blank">C97.net</a> before using this theme.
This theme was designed based on the theme (default). I found that the layout is overall very good. So I made very little change to the layout. However, I added more styles to give life to Kermana
## Changelog
1- I opted for a fixed position on the top menu. (The menu is now accessible at all times).

2- I took out the logo from the top menu. (The logo was too small for my taste.) The logo and the text can be added from the administration. I used the footer and navbar php. 

3- I built a mini header under the menu to put the logo and brand site on it. Add tag title on logo, the brand title in center.

4- I adding background images in png. I fixed the image to give an effect. The site seems to slide on the image. The image adapts to all screen resolutions.

5- To make it a little more dynamic, I added several different effects on several areas.

6- Adding an arrow to return to the top. No need to scroll down to go back to the top, Only need to click on the arrow.

8- I changed the copyright of the author's developer. I only put the link in blank. In this way another window opens and visitors do not leave the users' site.

9- I modified the right of the owner of the site, now only the name of the site appears without the slogan of the site.
The slogan is present in the header in a scrolling and very visible text.
