# Theme-Aqua-Dark for-Kermana
# Infos for Aqua-Dark
### Notes: This theme was developed for the Kermana-Directory script. If you don't have this script, you can visit C97.net before using this theme.
This theme was designed based on the theme (default). I found that the layout is overall very good. So I made very little change to the layout. However, I added more styles to give life to Kermana
## Changelog
1- I opted for a fixed position on the top menu. (The menu is now accessible at all times.
2- I took out the logo from the top menu. (The logo was too small for my taste.) The logo and the text can be added from the administration. I used the footer and navbar php.
